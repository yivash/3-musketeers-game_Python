    <p>The "board" is represented as a list of five lists; each of these lists
      represents a row, and each list contains five elements. The first list
      represents the first row; the first element in each list represents the
      first column. The values in the list must each be one of three things: an
      <code>'M'</code>, representing a Musketeer, an <code>'R'</code>,
      representing one of Cardinal Richelieu's men; and a <code>'-'</code>,
      representing an empty space. <code>board</code> is a
      global variable in this program.</p>
    <p>Directions are given as one of the four strings <code>'left'</code>, <code>'right'</code>,
      <code>'up</code>', and <code>'down'</code>.</p>
